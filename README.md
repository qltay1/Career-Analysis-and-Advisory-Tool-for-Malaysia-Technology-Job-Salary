# Career Analysis and Job Advisory for Malaysia Technology Jobs Salary

The dataset used for this project was a collection of surveys conducted on the local market of IT professionals in Malaysia. There are more than 30 distinctive features which includes a continuous feature of monthly base salary of the respondents.

This project aims to:

1. Provide an overview analysis of how graduates or professional's various features affect their monthly base salary.
2. Compare the performance of chosen ML algorithms which yields better results.
3. Present an classifier capable of predicting one's salary grouping to be either low, medium or high in the Malaysia market.
4. Recommend potential career change for technology professionals based on their current job title and job skills.

# Methodology

The thought process of presenting an optimum classifier was by experimenting with different features where continuous, nominal and text features were used accordingly as three different subsets of input data.  

The classifier was then evaluated according to typical performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. 

# Project Structure 
The file structure for this project would be:

1. Job_Advisor_Tool.ipynb which is used for analysis, visualization and classification throughout the entire project.
2. function.py, recommend.py and test.py which consists of the interactive web app functionality that can be run on local browser.
